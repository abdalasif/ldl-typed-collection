In this example, both key and value must comply to regex #[0-9]+#

Create collection instance
Add element with value: 2 and key: 1
Add element with value: 3 and key: 2
Validate KEY:
Try to add element 111, with key "def" which doesn't matches regex #[0-9]+#
EXCEPTION: Given value: "def" does not matches regex: "#[0-9]+#"

Validate VALUE:
Try to add element "def" which doesn't matches regex #[0-9]+#, with key 111
EXCEPTION: Given value: "def" does not matches regex: "#[0-9]+#"
