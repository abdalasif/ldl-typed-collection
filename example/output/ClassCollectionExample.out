Create new ClassCollection instance
Append class Test as a regular string:
array (
  0 => 'Test',
)
Append class Test including global namespace:
array (
  0 => 'Test',
  1 => 'Test',
)

Append non-existing class as string NonExistingClass, (exception must be thrown)

OK: Exception: Value expected for "LDL\Validators\ClassExistenceValidator", must be a string representing an existing class, "string" was given. Perhaps an autoloader is missing? Perhaps the namespace of the class is typed incorrectly?
